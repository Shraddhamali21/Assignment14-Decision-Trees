1. COMAPNY DATASET

In this data science project, I tackled the task of analyzing a Company dataset to identify the key factors influencing high sales for a cloth manufacturing company. Leveraging the power of Decision Trees, I aimed to build a predictive model that could uncover the significant attributes or segments contributing to high sales. The dataset used for this analysis is named "Company_Data.csv," containing various attributes related to sales, competitor prices, demographics, advertising budgets, and more. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The cloth manufacturing company seeks to understand the factors or attributes that contribute to high sales in their business. By analyzing a dataset containing information on sales, competitor prices, income levels, advertising budgets, population sizes, shelf locations, demographic characteristics, and geographic locations, the goal is to build a Decision Tree model with the target variable "Sale" (converted into a categorical variable). This model will help identify the key segments or attributes that drive high sales for the company.
 
Approach:
 
The project followed a structured approach to model development and analysis, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the attributes.
 - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the target variable "Sale" for analysis.
 
2. Model Training using Decision Trees:
 - Implementing the Decision Tree algorithm to build a classification model for predicting high sales.
 - Configuring the Decision Tree model with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters.
 
3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
 - Evaluating the performance of the Decision Tree model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 - Visualizing the Decision Tree to interpret the key segments or attributes contributing to high sales.
 - Analyzing feature importance to identify the most influential factors affecting sales.
 
4. Insights and Recommendations:
 - Deriving actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis of the Decision Tree model.
 - Providing strategic recommendations to the cloth manufacturing company for optimizing sales strategies and targeting high-sales segments.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn, the project aimed to provide valuable insights into the factors driving high sales for the cloth manufacturing company. The project not only enhanced my skills in Decision Tree modeling but also underscored the importance of data-driven decision-making in business optimization and strategy development.



2. FRAUD DATASET

In this data science project, I addressed the task of modeling fraud detection using Decision Trees, aiming to classify individuals as "Risky" or "Good" based on their taxable income. Leveraging the inherent interpretability and simplicity of Decision Trees, I aimed to build a predictive model that identifies individuals with potentially fraudulent tax behaviors. The dataset used for this analysis is named "Fraud_check.csv," containing attributes such as education level, marital status, taxable income, work experience, and urban residence status. Here's an overview of the project:
 
Problem Statement:
 
The objective of the project is to develop a Decision Tree model for fraud detection, classifying individuals into two categories: "Risky" and "Good." Individuals with a taxable income of less than or equal to $30,000 are considered "Risky," while others are categorized as "Good." By analyzing attributes such as education level, marital status, work experience, and urban residence status, the goal is to build a model that accurately identifies potentially fraudulent tax behaviors.
 
Approach:
 
The project follows a structured approach to model development and analysis, encompassing the following key steps:
 
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
 - Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and characteristics of the attributes.
 - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the target variable for analysis.
 
2. Model Training using Decision Trees:
 - Implementing the Decision Tree algorithm to build a classification model for fraud detection.
 - Configuring the Decision Tree model with appropriate parameters and hyperparameters.
 
3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
 - Evaluating the performance of the Decision Tree model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 - Visualizing the Decision Tree to interpret the rules and criteria used for classifying individuals as "Risky" or "Good."
 
4. Insights and Recommendations:
 - Deriving actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis of the Decision Tree model.
 - Providing strategic recommendations for identifying and mitigating potential instances of fraud in tax reporting.
 
By leveraging Python programming language along with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, the project aims to provide a robust and interpretable model for fraud detection in tax reporting. The project not only enhances my skills in Decision Tree modeling but also highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in identifying and preventing fraudulent activities.
